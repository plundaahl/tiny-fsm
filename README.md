# TinyFSM
A tiny framework for declaratively building finite state machines in TypeScript. It's primarily a personal experiment, and secondly tool for use in my personal projects. However, I've attempted to make it as self-explanatory as possible, in case anyone else would like to use it. There are a couple of [examples](./examples), and it has decent test coverage.

## Usage
_TODO_

## Examples
To try the examples out for yourself:

1. Clone the project (`git clone https://github.com/plundaahl/tiny-fsm`)
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build-examples`
4. Open [./examples/index.html](./examples/index.html) in your favorite browser.
